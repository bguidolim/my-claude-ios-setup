<summary>Checklist for engine changes</summary>

Only check items that apply to this PR. Delete irrelevant ones.

- [ ] `.shellCommand` components have `supplementaryDoctorChecks` defined (`deriveDoctorCheck()` returns `nil` for shell actions)
- [ ] Any `fix()` implementation does cleanup/migration only — never installs or registers resources
- [ ] State migrations are guarded by `isNeeded()` to stay idempotent with `mcs sync`
- [ ] New file write/copy/delete paths use `PathContainment.safePath()` and handle the `nil` (escape) case
- [ ] Docs updated if behavior changed (`CLAUDE.md`, `docs/`, `techpack.yaml` schema in `ExternalPackManifest.swift`)
